"Webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your "
"site. From the receiver's perspective, it's a way to request notifications "
"when other sites mention it."

"A Webmention is a notification that one URL links to another. For example, "
"Alice writes an interesting post on her blog. Bob then writes a response to "
"her post on his own site, linking back to Alice's original post. Bob's "
"publishing software sends a Webmention to Alice notifying that her article "
"was replied to, and Alice's software can show that reply as a comment on "
"the original post."

"Sending a Webmention is not limited to blog posts, and can be used for "
"additional kinds of content and responses as well. For example, a response "
"can be an RSVP to an event, an indication that someone \"likes\" another "
"post, a \"bookmark\" of another post, and many others. Webmention enables "
"these interactions to happen across different websites, enabling a "
"distributed social web."
